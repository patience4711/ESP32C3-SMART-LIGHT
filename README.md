# ESP32C3-SMART-LIGHT
This is software for a very smart led controller with built-in timers and dim function. You can apply it in many cases.
For instance, you can wind the strip around a hollow plastic pipe to create a bulb that you can mount in a lantern or armature.
You can make a very intelligent and low-energy garden light that switches on about sunset and goes out at sunrise. 

The features it has are:
- easy to connect to wifi
- can be controlled via webui, mosquitto, http and optional buttons
- dimmable by moving a slider in the webui or via buttons(optional)
- 4 timers with advanced options
- every timer has its own dim level
- soft switch on and off
- simple hardware
- it logs memorable events
- easy to debug
